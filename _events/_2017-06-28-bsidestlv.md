The original Security BSides conference was founded in 2009 by a group of hackers, security researchers and people passionate about cyber security, keen to share their knowledge and ideas. Today, Security BSides is a global network of community organized, grassroots, non-profit security events taking place globally from Athens, to São Paulo—and now in sunny Tel Aviv, Israel, for the 2nd year!
