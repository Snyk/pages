Anytime you add artifacts to JFrog Xray, it takes note of all the dependencies you are using. When a new vulnerability that affects your artifacts is captured by Snyk Basic or Snyk Premium you will be immediately alerted about it (via email or with [custom watches](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/XRAY/Watches#Watches-Actions.1)).

* Continuously test your applications for known vulnerabilities
* Real time alerts when new vulnerabilities affect your code
* With Snyk Enterprise and Snyk Pro, connect directly to runtime platforms such as Heroku, Cloud Foundry, AWS Lambda and more to monitor your deployed code
