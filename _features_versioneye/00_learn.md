Snyk and Versioneye have been partnering together for quite some time with VersionEye using Snyk’s database of open source vulnerabilities to notify VersionEye customers about vulnerabilities in their Node.js dependencies.

For customers who relied on the vulnerability information for building their security posture, it will be settling to know that they can use Snyk directly to get those same notifications on Node.js vulnerabilities… and of course much more!
